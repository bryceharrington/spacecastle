Development principles:
=======================
   * Strive to always keep the game(s) playable without regression
   * Make as much of the engine configurable/overrideable as possible
   * Prefer existing libs over homegrown stuff


TODO
====
* Unit tests for the generic core objects
* Scale the board down by 2
* Scoring system
* Score board
* High score tracking
* Performance testing output
* Basic wall/sphere collision logic
* Add space mines
* Modify visual display of game elements based on how damaged they are
* Add levels
  - Increase speed of turret
  - Add mines
  - Solid walls
  - Cannon uses predictive logic when firing
  - Turret regenerates faster
  - Shields regenerate
* game objects have both draw and draw_func, but probably should only
  have one or the other.  draw() just causes stuff to break and should
  be removed, or made to call draw_func
* Canvas items have pos/rot/scale, but then game objects have physics
  p's with their own pos.
