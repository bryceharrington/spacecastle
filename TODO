Development principles:
=======================
   * Strive to always keep the game(s) playable without regression
   * Make as much of the engine configurable/overrideable as possible
   * Prefer existing libs over homegrown stuff
   * Copy from other sources in preference to re-invention
   * When inventing, do the least possible to get it working
   * When re-inventing, create something an order of magnitude better

3.  Abstract a Game class to use for future games
4.  Establish some basic but reusable wall/sphere collision logic
