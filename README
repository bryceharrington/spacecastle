About InkDrop
=============
InkDrop is a technology development effort organized around production
of a simple game.  The principle goals are, in order of importance:

   * To serve as a proof of concept vehicle for new technologies for
     Inkscape, including:
     - Integration of Cairo, 2geom, and gtkmm
     - Some kind of object/canvas layer atop cairo

   * To create a simple but addictive game, to enhance the enjoyment of
     Open Source Desktops

   * Create a framework that facilitates creation of additional
     Cairo-based games, by generalizing game code into reusable
     components, and by making use of as much existing 3rd-party code as
     feasible.

   * Lay the groundwork for building a new Inkscape/Cairo/Gnome game
     development community, that can reverse the notion that Linux is a
     games-poor platform.
